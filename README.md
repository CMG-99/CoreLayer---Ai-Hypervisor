## 🔧 CRITICAL BUG FIXES IMPLEMENTED

### 1. VM Parsing Error - FIXED ✅
**Problem:** Application was failing to parse the updated list of VMs from Hyper-V, causing crashes or showing stale data.

**Solution Implemented:**
- Enhanced PowerShell JSON output handling with better error catching
- Added robust JSON parsing with fallback mechanisms
- Implemented proper empty result handling
- Added HTML escaping to prevent injection issues
- Fixed the Uptime formatting to handle all cases properly
- Added better error messages for debugging

**Key Fix in renderer.js:**
```javascript
// Clean JSON output and handle edge cases
let jsonStr = result.stdout.trim();
if (!jsonStr || jsonStr === '' || jsonStr === 'null') {
    jsonStr = '[]';
}
// Fallback JSON extraction if output contains extra text
const jsonMatch = jsonStr.match(/\[[\s\S]*\]|\{[\s\S]*\}/);
```

### 2. Memory Leak in Stats Loop - FIXED ✅
- Optimized the stats update interval
- Added proper cleanup on view switches

### 3. Double-Click VM Connect - ENHANCED ✅
- Added double-click functionality to connect to VMs directly
- Improved VMConnect integration
